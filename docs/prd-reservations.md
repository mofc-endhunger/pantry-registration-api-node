### PRD: Reservations API (List, Get) and Read Model (Local‑only Scope)

#### Author

- Owner: Engineering
- Stakeholders: Product, Frontend, Operations

### 1) Overview

- Add user-facing reservations capabilities using only data tracked locally:
  - List a user’s reservations (upcoming, past, all) with locally available event/timeslot details.
  - Fetch a single reservation by id.
  - Out of scope (for now): waitlist, cancel, check‑in/completed states, and any PantryTrak/public data enrichment.

### 2) Goals

- Provide a stable read model for “reservations” suitable for web and mobile UI, based solely on local tables.
- Support filtering (upcoming/past/all), date‑range constraints, and pagination using only locally known dates/times.
- Keep the response schema minimal and aligned with local data available today.

### 3) Non‑Goals

- Staff/admin event management UI/API changes (covered elsewhere).
- Notification templates/content; this PRD includes hooks only.
- Historical archiving and purge policies (policy to be decided later).

### 4) Definitions

- Reservation: A user household’s `Registration` for an event or local timeslot.
- HOH: Head of Household (registration/household rules already defined elsewhere).
- Public/External data: Out of scope (no PantryTrak enrichment).

### 5) Endpoints

- GET `/api/reservations`
  - Purpose: list the authenticated user’s reservations.
  - Auth: JWT or `X-Guest-Token` (same scoping as existing registrations flows).
  - Query params:
    - `type`: `upcoming | past | all` (default `all`)
    - `from_date`: ISO date (YYYY‑MM‑DD)
    - `to_date`: ISO date (YYYY‑MM‑DD)
    - `limit`: number (default 50, max 200)
    - `offset`: number (default 0)
  - Filtering logic:
    - Determine reservation “date/time” using, in order (local only):
      1. `timeslot.start_at` (if present)
      2. `event.start_at` (if present)
      3. If neither is available, the item is included in `all` but excluded from `upcoming/past` filtered sets.
    - `upcoming`: `date >= today`
    - `past`: `date < today`
    - `all`: no extra filter
    - Apply `from_date`/`to_date` window when a date can be determined.
  - Response:
    - `200 OK`
    - Body:
      ```json
      {
        "reservations": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "event": {
              "id": 101,
              "name": "Family Love Pantry"
            },
            "date": "2026-01-17",
            "timeslot": {
              "start_time": "2026-01-17T09:00:00.000Z",
              "end_time": "2026-01-17T15:00:00.000Z"
            },
            "household_id": 1,
            "created_at": "2026-01-09T10:30:00.000Z",
            "updated_at": "2026-01-09T10:30:00.000Z"
          }
        ],
        "total": 5,
        "upcoming_count": 2,
        "past_count": 3
      }
      ```
    - Notes:
      - Response contains only fields available from local tables (`events`, `event_timeslots`, `registrations`). No external/public enrichment.

- GET `/api/reservations/{id}`
  - Purpose: fetch a single reservation owned by the authenticated user.
  - Auth: JWT or `X-Guest-Token`.
  - Response:
    - `200 OK` with `{"reservation": { ...same schema as list item... }}`
    - `404` if not found or not owned.

  - Out of scope (for now): cancel endpoint; no waitlist promotion or status changes.

### 6) Data Model Changes (Migrations)

- None required for MVP list/get.
- Optional (future): `confirmation_code` for display and QR (if desired later).

### 7) Domain/Status Mapping

- Out of scope: waitlist, cancel, check‑in/completed. The read model does not depend on or expose these states.

### 8) Business Rules

- History ranges:
  - Support `from_date`/`to_date` on locally known dates; items without a resolvable date participate only in `all`.

### 9) Read Model Construction

- Base query: by `household_id` owned by the caller; apply type/date filters; paginate.
- Joins/enrichment:
  - If `timeslot_id` present: join `EventTimeslot` for `start_at/end_at` and derive `date`.
  - Else use `Event.start_at` when present.
  - No public/external enrichment.
- Derived fields:
  - None beyond local relations for MVP. (Optional future: `confirmation_code` and QR.)

### 10) External/Public Data

- Out of scope. No PantryTrak/public DB reads or writes in this iteration.

### 11) Notifications

- Out of scope.

### 12) Errors & Security

- `401` on auth failures, `403` on ownership/role failures, `404` unknown ids, `400` for rule violations.
- Ownership: resolve `household_id` via JWT or `X-Guest-Token` (same as existing registration flows).

### 13) Performance & Pagination

- Default `limit=50`, `offset` based pagination; cap max limit to 200.
- Indexing: ensure indexes on `registrations(household_id, status, created_at)`, and on `timeslot_id`, `event_id` as needed for joins.

### 14) Rollout Plan

- Step 1: Implement read model service and controller for list/get (local joins only).
- Step 2: Frontend integration and UX review.
- Step 3: Optional future steps (confirmation codes, QR, cancel) gated by scope decisions.

### 15) Open Questions

- Event metadata:
  - Are `event.start_at` and `event_timeslots.start_at/end_at` reliably populated for filtering?
  - Any additional local fields needed for display (e.g., short venue name)?
- History defaults:
  - Preferred default window for “past” in UI (Frontend suggested 2 weeks minimum)?

### 16) Success Metrics

- Reduction in support requests around “where is my reservation?”
- API performance: p95 latency < 200ms for list and get (excluding public enrichment calls if any).

### 17) Risks

- Limited local date/time data may constrain filtering accuracy for some records.
- Future scope changes (cancel, waitlist, QR) may require response schema evolution.

### 18) Appendix

- Existing endpoints impacted:
  - New aliases under `/api/reservations` for list/get to provide a user‑centric API surface.
