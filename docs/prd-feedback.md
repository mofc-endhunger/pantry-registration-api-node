## PRD: Post-Event Feedback (Per Registration)

### Overview

Collect structured post-event feedback from a guest or authenticated user after an event registration. Feedback consists of a required 1–5 star rating, optional free-text comments, and answers to a simple fixed questionnaire (1–5 scale questions). Questionnaire authoring/maintenance is out of scope; only presentation and capture are in scope.

### Goals

- Enable guests/users to submit feedback per reservation/registration.
- Capture a required 1–5 rating; allow optional comments (free text).
- Present a simple, fixed questionnaire (versioned for future changes) using 1–5 scale responses.
- Make results queryable per registration, user, event, and time window.

### Non-Goals / Out of Scope

- Authoring/maintaining questionnaires (UI/admin tools).
- Advanced survey types (text/multi-select/NPS/free-form per-question).
- Public leaderboards or complex analytics dashboards.
- Email/SMS distribution automation (can be added later).

### Personas & Scenarios

- Guest or authenticated user who completed/attended an event and wants to provide feedback.
- Staff reviewing aggregate scores and comments by event or time period.

### Assumptions

- A registration is required to submit feedback; one feedback per registration.
- We can determine event timing (date/time) from existing public schedule integrations to enforce windows (e.g., submit within 14 days after event).
- Questionnaire is deployed as a single “active” version. Future versions may be rolled out but management is external to this scope.

## API

### Authentication/Authorization

- Same as Reservations: JWT or `X-Guest-Token` with ownership checks; the caller must own the `registration` (reservation) to read/submit feedback.

### Endpoints

- GET `/reservations/:id/feedback`
  - Returns current feedback if submitted; otherwise returns the active questionnaire scaffold for this registration.
  - Ownership required.

- POST `/reservations/:id/feedback`
  - Creates feedback once per registration; returns 201 with created resource.
  - If duplicate submit: return 409 Conflict (or optionally 200 with existing feedback if idempotency is preferred; to be decided).
  - Ownership required.

- GET `/questionnaires/current` (optional helper)
  - Returns currently active questionnaire (for clients that want to prefetch).
  - No ownership requirement; standard auth applies.

### Request/Response Shapes

- GET `/reservations/:id/feedback` 200

  "responses": [
    { "question_id": 101, "scale_value": 5 },
    { "question_id": 102, "scale_value": 4 },
    { "question_id": 103, "scale_value": 5 }
  ]
}
```

- POST `/reservations/:id/feedback` 201 response

```json
{
  "id": 98765,
  "registration_id": 12345,
  "submitted_at": "2026-01-20T14:05:12.000Z",
  "rating": 5,
  "comments": "Great experience, very organized."
}
```

### Validation

- `rating`: required, integer 1–5.
- `comments`: optional, <= 1000 chars.
- `responses`: optional; each item must reference a known `question_id` in the active questionnaire, with `scale_value` 1–5. All required questions must be present if `responses` is provided.
- One submission per registration.

### Business Rules

- Submission allowed only after the event date (or after check-in/completion if available). Default: allow from event date at 00:00 local → 14 days after.
- Ownership: only the registration owner can create/view feedback for that registration.
- Questionnaire is versioned; we snapshot `questionnaire_version_id` on feedback creation.

### Error Cases

- 401/403: unauthenticated/unauthorized or not owner.
- 404: registration not found or not eligible.
- 409: duplicate feedback submission (if we choose conflict over idempotent return).
- 422: validation error (rating out of range, missing required responses).

## Questionnaire (v1 content, example)

- Title: Post-Event Feedback
- Questions:
  - Q1 (order 1): “How satisfied were you with check-in?” (scale_1_5, required)
  - Q2 (order 2): “How satisfied were you with wait time?” (scale_1_5, required)
  - Q3 (order 3): “How satisfied were you with overall service?” (scale_1_5, required)
- End: “Any comments?” → stored as `feedback.comments`

## Security & Privacy

- Enforce registration ownership through existing guards (JWT/guest).
- Store minimal metadata (`ip`, `user_agent`) for abuse detection; subject to privacy policy.
- Rate limiting: basic per-IP throttling on POST to prevent abuse (policy TBD).

## Rollout

- Phase 1: API + minimal UI to present questionnaire on reservation history detail.
- Phase 2: Add server-side enforcement of submission window (e.g., 14 days).
- Phase 3: Staff reports/aggregations (avg rating per event, comments export).

## Addendum: Align with Survey Engine (Owner Spec 2026‑01‑28)

To align with the survey engine proposal, we will introduce a generalized schema and endpoints while preserving the current simple feedback flow as a compatibility facade.

### Engine Data Model

- forms (id, title, status_id, created_at)
- questions (id, prompt, type['scale_1_5'|'radio'|'checkbox'|'short_text'], is_standardized)
- answer_options (id, question_id, value, label, display_order)
- form_assignments (id, form_id, hierarchy_type_id, hierarchy_value)
- survey_triggers (id, assignment_id, trigger_type['transactional'|'milestone'|'time_cohort'], interval_value)
- form_submissions (id, form_id, trigger_id, registration_id, user_id, overall_rating, comments, date_key, time_key, ip_address, date_added, status_id)
- form_responses (id, submission_id, question_id, answer_value)

Constraints:

- Durable immutability: Once submissions exist for a form/version, do not edit/delete questions or associations; deactivate instead.
- Submission window: Default 14 days post service date for transactional triggers.

### Engine Endpoints

- GET /surveys/active?registration_id=123
  - Evaluates eligibility for transactional surveys and returns the applicable form with questions/options if available; otherwise has_active=false.
- POST /surveys/submit
  - Body: { form_id, trigger_id, registration_id?, overall_rating?, comments?, responses: [{ question_id, answer_value }] }
  - Captures IP and User‑Agent. Enforces duplicate protection and 14‑day window for transactional context.

### Backwards Compatibility

- Existing GET/POST /reservations/:id/feedback remain; they will be backed by the engine in a later phase, mapping rating/comments to form_submissions and per‑question answers to form_responses.

### Phase Plan

- Phase A (now): Add engine tables and endpoints (transactional only).
- Phase B: Wire feedback facade to engine; migrate data.
- Phase C: Add milestone/time‑cohort triggers and background jobs.

## Success Metrics

- Submission rate: % of eligible registrations with feedback.
- Avg overall rating and distribution over time.
- Median time-to-feedback after event date.
- Error rate (409/422) and drop-offs.

## Open Questions

- Duplicate handling: 409 vs idempotent upsert returning existing?
- Submission window policy and reminder communications (email/SMS)?
- Should comments length limit be 1000 or 2000 chars?
- Do we need soft-delete/edit for feedback (default: no edits, no deletes)?
