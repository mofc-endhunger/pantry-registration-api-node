# Product Requirements Document (PRD): User Authentication & Management

## 1. Introduction/Overview
This document outlines the requirements for porting the User Authentication & Management functionality from the legacy freshtrak-registration-api-master (Ruby on Rails) to a new NestJS-based service (pantry-registration-api-node). The goal is a direct, feature-complete port, enabling seamless integration with the existing codebase as part of a strangulation migration strategy. No UI is required; the API will be headless and include Swagger documentation.

## 2. Goals
- Replicate all authentication and user management features from the legacy system
- Ensure API endpoints are compatible for integration with existing and future services
- Provide Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints

## 3. User Stories
- As a user or admin, I want to register, authenticate, and manage my account using the same flows as the legacy system
- As a developer, I want to integrate the new API with minimal changes to existing client code
- As an admin, I want to manage user roles and permissions as in the legacy system

## 4. Functional Requirements
1. The system must support all authentication methods present in the legacy system (email/password, OAuth, guest login, etc.)
2. The system must allow user registration, login, password reset, and profile management
3. The system must support both end users and admin users
4. The system must enforce the same security and compliance rules as the legacy system
5. The system must support user roles and permissions as in the legacy system
6. The API must be headless (no UI), but provide Swagger documentation
7. All endpoints and data contracts must match the legacy system for easy integration

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- No new features or enhancements beyond the legacy system
- No UI or frontend implementation
- No additional security or compliance requirements beyond what exists in the legacy system

## 6. Design Considerations
- Follow the module/controller/service/entity structure of pantry-finder-api-node
- Use DTOs for request/response validation
- Implement Swagger decorators for all endpoints

## 7. Technical Considerations
- Use TypeORM for data access
- Use NestJS guards and strategies for authentication/authorization
- Ensure compatibility with existing database schema and data
- Use environment-based configuration for secrets and sensitive data

## 8. Success Metrics
- All legacy authentication and user management features are available and tested in the new API
- The new API is integrated into the codebase with minimal changes to client code
- Swagger documentation is complete and accurate

## 9. Open Questions
- Are there any undocumented edge cases or flows in the legacy system that need special attention?
- Are there any deprecated endpoints or features that should be excluded?
